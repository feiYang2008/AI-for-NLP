个人认为数据驱动是一个理想概念，以可交互性机器人为例，我们预设好一个系统，里面包含预设的反馈方式及对应规则。人们通过输入数据或调参,\n"," 来让他达到用特定方式反馈特定信息，从而达到类似学习并最终到智能的效果。但真正意义上来说，这个机器更像是记下数据及经验，并不一定智能。\n"," 但是这个过程中人们并没有在对他系统核心方法进行额外的改进优化，唯一的变量只有输入的数据。\n","\n"," 在这个程序中，我构建好了分词规则，模式选择（随机）, 以及信息提取方式（\"？X\", \"?*X\"），我们在这里的输入的数据是模式规则（rules）。\n"," 当我们为其输入的rules足够细分的时候，该程序能做到精确反馈人们的大部分信息。\n","\n"," 4. 目前大部分AI的核心思想即为基于数据的经验主义模型。意思是模型本身不会思考不会类比，只是记住了得到正确答案的方式。而模型总结方式的过程\n"," 就是一次数据驱动的过程。主要关系为AI系统依赖于数据去“学习”如何解决复杂问题。"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":284,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
