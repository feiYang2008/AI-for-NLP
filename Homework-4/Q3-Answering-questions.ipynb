      "source": "1. Why do we need dynamic programming? What\u0027s the difference of dynamic programming and previous talked search problme?\n\nans: We need DP to increase the efficiency. It removed duplicated operations in robust search. \n\n2. Why do we still need dynamic programming? Why not we train a machine learning to fit a function which could get the right answer based on inputs?\n\nans: It still works well in discrete optimization problems. Finding a function to fit the problem is comparable too idea to satisfy, especially in discrete case.\nInstead of fitting a function, dynamic programming didn\u0027t change the solution but provided an idea to remove trivial, duplicated, and repeated operations. A machine learning \nmethod was not able to keep robust permanently and bring with uncertainties.\n\n3. Can you catch up at least 3 problems which could solved by Dynamic Programming?\n\nans: \n* Route planning optimization given caches.\n* Making decision under fixed conditions\n* In ML, back-propagation of RNN sequence\n\n\n4. Can you catch up at least 3 problems wich could sloved by Edit Distance?\n\nans: 1. In English, detecting duplicates of record in Database.  2. Stemming of words.  3. plagiarization judgement  \n\n5. Please summarize the three main features of Dynamic Programming, and make a concise explain for each feature.\n\nans: \n\n6. What\u0027s the disadvantages of Dynamic Programming? (You may need search by yourself in Internet).\n\nans: Hard to find transition equation"
